# Welcome to the IOT and Smart Cities Working Group!

Thank you for your interest in participating in the ACT-IAC Emerging Technology IoT and Smart City Working Group.  The scope of this group includes Industrial Internet of Things, Sensors, Actuators, Some Consumer Devices and even Edge and Fog Computing.  Our goals are to develop a primer, share use cases for IoT and Edge Computing that will support the federal government during this unprecedented time, especially with a lens for cyber security, and host events to help educate and inform the community.  We will also think about use cases for scenarios that will drive the mission of government during and post the pandemic.  

## Repository
We utalize Box as our document and information repository

## Connect with our Members
You can find the roster here. Based on your interest, availability, and experience, we expect there will be three types of members of this group.  Please review the following roles below:
1.	Co-Admin: The Co-Admins will lead the overall strategy and vision for the group.  They will handle the logistics (meeting scheduling, note taking, etc.) and will serve as the main POCs into the broader ACT-IAC community.  
2.	Contributor: Contributors will have a leadership role of the working group based on the different criteria.   They will be the leading voice for the different sub-working groups.  
3.	Member:  Members will participate in the groups led by the contributors and provide feedback.  They will review our deliverables and contribute their insights to the broader group. 

You can use the team link above for Box and navigate to: 
ET COI Team Folder > ACT-IAC IOT > Members

As we move forward with this working group, we would like to get to know everyone a little better.  If you have a bio, we invite you to post it in this area.  Or perhaps just a screen shot of your LinkedIN Profile or a couple of sentences about you (your background, experience, interest, etc.)

### Collaborate on box
Collaborate live on Microsoft Office documents in Box
Box allows multiple people to simultaneously edit Microsoft Office documents stored in Box via the new Box for Office Online real-time co-authoring features. This is similar to the simultaneous editing features already available in Google Docs. Some highlights:

There is no need to convert a Microsoft Office document to another format before working on it together.

When multiple people are editing a document, their names will appear in the upper right corner.

Your collaborator's text cursor will appear in a unique color, and their name will be displayed next to it.

All edits are automatically saved, avoiding version conflict. It’s easy to pull up a previous version to reference old content whenever needed.

## ACT-IAC COMMUNITIES OF INTEREST (COI)
 
The  Communities of Interest (COIs) are the heart of the ACT-IAC collaborative forum, where government and industry are working together to develop best practices, new solutions, and innovative strategies to improve government through the application of technology. The COIs address specific areas and provide an opportunity for government and industry to work together to improve government. COIs enable awareness of community events, activities, news, and other information sharing. They also host programming that interests their members and establish projects and events that enable close collaboration. 

The COIs provide a government-driven, objective, vendor-neutral ethical forum where government and industry communicate and collaborate. Participation in the COIs is open to all ACT-IAC current members.  

 For additional information, please contact Nancy Delanoche, Director for Communities of Interest
