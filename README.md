# Welcome to the IoT and Smart Communities Working Group!

Thank you for your interest in participating in the ACT-IAC Emerging Technology IoT and Smart Communities Working Group. The scope of this group includes Industrial Internet of Things, Sensors, Actuators, Some Consumer Devices, and even Edge and Fog Computing. Our goals are to develop a primer, share use cases for IoT and Edge Computing that will support the federal government during this unprecedented time, especially with a lens for cybersecurity, and host events to help educate and inform the community. We will also think about use cases for scenarios that will drive the mission of government during and post the pandemic.

## TITLE: Addressing The Digital Divide: Rural Tribal Broadband
• ABSTRACT (draft): On June 3, 2021, the National Telecommunication and Information Administration (NTIA) issued a historic Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) and began accepting applications for $1 billion in available grant funding under the Tribal Broadband Connectivity Program (TBCP). Improving and Expanding the Nation’s broadband infrastructure will require investment in the people, processes, and technologies to make broadband affordable for all Americans, specifically those that are underserved and unserved. While technology can/will underpin a future-state foundation for economic and social benefits, it is paramount that all of humanity realize access to the communications necessary to foster digital inclusion, streamline digital equity, and bridge the digital divide.

## 12/17    Meeting - IoT Smart Cities Working Group 12:00 AM EST
### Learning Series
Let's light this candle: it has been confirmed that our speakers -- included here -- are all available at 12:00pm EST, 12/17 for the first in our much anticipated six-month IoT and Smart Cities learning series for the ACT-IAC IoT Working Group. 

For background, the series will include (we can change the naming obviously, for some reason I have rap battles in my mind:
* •	IoT x Smart Cities (Dec. 17, 12:00pm EST)
* •	IoT x Infrastructure (January)
3* •	IoT x Participation (February)
* •	IoT x Data (March)
* •	IoT x Safety (April)
* •	IoT x Climate (May)
Each session will be approximately/at most 45 minutes total, including introductions, five(ish) minute presentations by speakers), and moderated discussion. We will deep dive into this for the first session in a follow-up email. 

Our speakers for the first session, moderated by Justin Herman, will include:
•	Dan Morgan, chief data officer, U.S. Department of Transportation, and ACT-IAC IoT Working Group Government Sponsor
•	Scott Lemon, principle IoT solutions engineer, Twilio
•	Chelsea Collier, founder of Digi.City, editor-at-large of Smart Cities Connect and co-author of The Smart Cities Playbook
Berrak, from Twilio IoT Marketing, and Chelsea (both cc'ed) will both be promoting this among the national IoT and Smart Cities community, and we will have a promotional image created in order to help achieve that. 

These sessions will be open to anyone to build a robust community going into the new year, so let's plan to open the doors wide.

## Connect with our Members
You can find the roster here. Based on your interest, availability, and experience, we expect there will be three types of members of this group.  Please review the following roles below:
1.	Co-Admin: The Co-Admins will lead the overall strategy and vision for the group.  They will handle the logistics (meeting scheduling, note-taking, etc.) and will serve as the main POCs in the broader ACT-IAC community.  
2.	Contributor: Contributors will have a leadership role in the working group based on the different criteria.   They will be the leading voice for the different sub-working groups.  
3.	Member:  Members will participate in the groups led by the contributors and provide feedback.  They will review our deliverables and contribute their insights to the broader group.

### Collaborate on box
Collaborate live on Microsoft Office documents in Box
Box allows multiple people to simultaneously edit Microsoft Office documents stored in Box via the new Box for Office Online real-time co-authoring features. This is similar to the simultaneous editing features already available in Google Docs. Some highlights:

There is no need to convert a Microsoft Office document to another format before working on it together.

When multiple people are editing a document, their names will appear in the upper right corner.

Your collaborator's text cursor will appear in a unique color, and their name will be displayed next to it.

All edits are automatically saved, avoiding version conflict. It’s easy to pull up a previous version to reference old content whenever needed.

## ACT-IAC COMMUNITIES OF INTEREST (COI)
 
The  Communities of Interest (COIs) are the heart of the ACT-IAC collaborative forum, where government and industry are working together to develop best practices, new solutions, and innovative strategies to improve government through the application of technology. The COIs address specific areas and provide an opportunity for government and industry to work together to improve government. COIs enable awareness of community events, activities, news, and other information sharing. They also host programming that interests their members and establishes projects and events that enable close collaboration. 

The COIs provide a government-driven, objective, vendor-neutral, ethical forum where government and industry communicate and collaborate. Participation in the COIs is open to all ACT-IAC current members.
