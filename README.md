# Welcome to the IOT and Smart Cities Working Group!

Thank you for your interest in participating in the ACT-IAC Emerging Technology IoT and Smart City Working Group.  The scope of this group includes Industrial Internet of Things, Sensors, Actuators, Some Consumer Devices and even Edge and Fog Computing.  The goal will be to share use cases for IoT and Edge Computing that will support the federal government during this unprecedented time, especially with a lens for cyber security.  We will also think about use cases for scenarios that will drive the mission of government during and post the pandemic.

## Connect with our Members
You can find the roster here. Based on your interest, availability, and experience, we expect there will be three types of members of this group.  Please review the following roles below:
1.	Co-Admin: The Co-Admins will lead the overall strategy and vision for the group.  They will handle the logistics (meeting scheduling, note taking, etc.) and will serve as the main POCs into the broader ACT-IAC community.  
2.	Contributor: Contributors will have a leadership role of the working group based on the different criteria.   They will be the leading voice for the different sub-working groups.  
3.	Member:  Members will participate in the groups led by the contributors and provide feedback.  They will review our deliverables and contribute their insights to the broader group.
