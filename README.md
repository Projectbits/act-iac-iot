# Welcome to the IOT and Smart Cities Working Group!

Thank you for your interest in participating in the ACT-IAC Emerging Technology IoT and Smart City Working Group.  The scope of this group includes Industrial Internet of Things, Sensors, Actuators, Some Consumer Devices and even Edge and Fog Computing.  Our goals are to develop a primer, share use cases for IoT and Edge Computing that will support the federal government during this unprecedented time, especially with a lens for cyber security, and host events to help educate and inform the community.  We will also think about use cases for scenarios that will drive the mission of government during and post the pandemic.

## Deliverables

### Primer Signup
Primer Signup Sheet - Dont be bashful - sign up here for your sections of interest (This spreadsheet may easier to edit if you download it since the alignment has limited office online support.  Just add your name in the first blank column going left to right and put an x in each section you plan to contribute to:

### Collaborate on box
Collaborate live on Microsoft Office documents in Box
Box allows multiple people to simultaneously edit Microsoft Office documents stored in Box via the new Box for Office Online real-time co-authoring features. This is similar to the simultaneous editing features already available in Google Docs. Some highlights:

There is no need to convert a Microsoft Office document to another format before working on it together.

When multiple people are editing a document, their names will appear in the upper right corner.

Your collaborator's text cursor will appear in a unique color, and their name will be displayed next to it.

All edits are automatically saved, avoiding version conflict. It’s easy to pull up a previous version to reference old content whenever needed.

## ACT-IAC COMMUNITIES OF INTEREST (COI)
 
The  Communities of Interest (COIs) are the heart of the ACT-IAC collaborative forum, where government and industry are working together to develop best practices, new solutions, and innovative strategies to improve government through the application of technology. The COIs address specific areas and provide an opportunity for government and industry to work together to improve government. COIs enable awareness of community events, activities, news, and other information sharing. They also host programming that interests their members and establish projects and events that enable close collaboration. 

The COIs provide a government-driven, objective, vendor-neutral ethical forum where government and industry communicate and collaborate. Participation in the COIs is open to all ACT-IAC current members.  

 For additional information, please contact Nancy Delanoche, Director for Communities of Interest
